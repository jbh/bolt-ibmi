# Bolt IBM i
A myriad of bolt plans for IBM i.

## What is Bolt?
[Bolt](https://www.puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/bolt.html) is an open source orchestration tool,
provided by Puppet, that automates infrastructure. Bolt has a much less steep learning curve than
Puppet itself, and it's quite flexible, allowingyou to easily and conveniently take advantage of
your already existing infrastructure automation scripts.

While you **can** use the Puppet Agent alongside Bolt, it isn't necessary, which is great for
users of IBM i, since the Puppet Agent doesn't yet support the IBM i platform.

## Prerequisites
- Local machine
  - [Bolt CLI](https://www.puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/bolt_installing.html)
- IBM i
  - [Open Source Package Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/getting-started-open-source-package-management-ibm-i-acs)
